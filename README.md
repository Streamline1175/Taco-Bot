# Taco-Bot
Allows users from Discord to search Taco Places around them within a 25 mile radius based on the passed location argument

Introducing the @Taco Bot that is at your service for finding the most reviewed and highly rated Taco Places (Restaurants and Taco Trucks) around you based on the location you give it!

You can call upon the bot by simply leveraging these types of examples or you can put literally anything and the bot might just spit something back at you:
```
!tacos "NYC"
!tacos "San Fran"
!tacos "Seattle"
!tacos "78230"
!tacos "169 Rocky River Dr. Fresno, CA 93727"
!tacos "times square"
```

Just remember if you are using multiple strings enclose them in double quotes to ensure the bot reads it correctly.
